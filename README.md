# Starblazer-II

To-do List  
1. Port ECS from pre-Slipstream Starblazer (adapt any Slipstream code as needed, modify data structures, get the old Object/Entity system working in 3D)  
2. Octahedron generator  
3. Z-sort  
4. Fix clipping  
5. Basic on-rails dogfights -> enemies fly at you, you shoot them, you hit them, they blow up  
6. Bring the HUD back

2. Backgrounds, free-range dogfights, other housekeeping stuff (TBD)
