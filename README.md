To-do List
1.) Port ECS from pre-Slipstream Starblazer (adapt any Slipstream code as needed, modify data structures, get the old Object/Entity system working in 3D)
2.) Octahedron generator
3.) Z-sort
4.) Fix clipping
5.) Basic on-rails dogfights -> enemies fly at you, you shoot them, you hit them, they blow up
6.) Bring the HUD back
7.) Filled polygons

Other
1.) SoundBlaster SFX/music
2.) Backgrounds, free-range dogfights, other housekeeping stuff (TBD)
